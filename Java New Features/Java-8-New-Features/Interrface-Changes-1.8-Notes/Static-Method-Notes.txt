		
										Static Method In Interface
								------------------------------------------------------------------------

	=> Before Java 1.8, we can write only one type of method inside the interface 
	     only the abstract method 
	 
	=> But fron onward java 1.8 we can write many type of method inside the 
	     interface like -
	     	1. abstract method
		2. defualt method
		3. static method

	=> abstract method means we have must to implements the abstract class logic

	=> defualt method means we can override that method inside the implementation 
	     class.

	=> The interface don't force to implements the default method inside the implementation
	     class.

	=> stattic method means, if we write static concreate method inside the interface then 
	     we can't not override that  static method inside the implementation class 

	=> static method also executed with interface name like class name ( class/interface.static method name)
