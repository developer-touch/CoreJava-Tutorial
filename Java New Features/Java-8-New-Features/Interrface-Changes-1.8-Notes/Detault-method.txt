	=> Upto java-7v inside interface we can create only below 3 members 
		1. public static final class
		2. public abstract methods
		3. public static inner classes

	=> From java-8v inside interface we can also create
		4. public default implemented methods
		5. public static implemented methods

	=> From java-9v inside interface we can also create
		6. private static implemeted methods
		7. private non-static implemented methods

	----------------------------------------------------------------
	>>>>>Default Implementation Method<<<<<<<
	----------------------------------------------------------------
		-> The default method is a java 8v new features

		-> It is an interface method which contains default implementation 

		-> A method with implementation body in 'interface' with the keyword
		    'default' is called default method

		-> It is used for creating new methods in interface without forcing
		    implementation classes to implement those method.

		-> From Java 8v onwards in interface we can create types of methods 
			1. A method without body that is 'public abstract method' to force
			    implementation classes to implement it
			2. A method with body that is 'public default implemented method'
			    without forcing implementation classes to implement it

		-> Then what is diiference b/w 'abstract class and Java 8v interface ?
			-> Whatever the differences we have b/w AC and interface in upto 
			    Java 7v same difference still we hava in Java 8v also

			1. Java 8v interface still not have constructor and can not be instantiated
			    either directly or via implementation class

			2. Java 8v interface still support multiple type inheritance even though
			    it have implementation methods.

		=> For creation the default method we must use 'default' keyword (modifier)
				public default <RT> <mN>(<PL> throws EL> {
					---------------
					------------------
				}

				-> public is optional, compiler will add it
				-> default is mandatory,else compiler throws error
