									    Functional Interface
								=============================

	-> An interface that contains only one abstract method is called Functional Interface

	-> A single abstract method interface is called Functional Interface

	-> A Functional Interface  used to developing a Lambda Expression for passing logic
	    directly as argument to a method without creating separate class and object 

	-> A Functional interface is created by using the keyword interrface but it must have
	    only one 'abstract method'

	-> It can hava 'n' number of default and static and private methods

	-> We can stoped adding more method in side funtional interface by using the annotation
	    ' @FunctionalInterface'

	-> @FunctionalInterface is allowed only one abstract method inside the inteface and it 
	    marked with a function as FunctionalInterfacr


	How can we implements a Functional Interface ?
		1. By using the outer class
		2. By using the anonymous inner class
		3. By using the Lambda Expression 
		4. By using the method reference 


	Examlpe of Functional Interface
	-------------------------------------------
	1.	interface Addition {	
			public void add(int a,int b);
		}

		@FunctionalInterface
	2.	interface Addition {
			public void add(int a,int b);
		}

		@FunctionalInterface
	3.	interface Calculator {
			public void calculate(int a,int b);
		}

		interface Addition extends Calculator{
			
		}
