==============================
Java-11 => Compile Free Lunch 
==============================
	-> From Java 11, java provides flexibility to run java code without compilation 

        -> We can execute java code in a single step

        -> Use single command java filename.java and it will execute the file by producing
           desired result

          public class A {		=> java A(file name).java
               public static void main(String[] args){
             	     Sop("hi");
               }
          }

=============================
Java-11 => New String Method
=============================
     -> Java 11 introduced a few new method to String class

     1. isBlank() => this method is used to check weather a string is blank or not

                  => Empty string and string with just white space are considered blank

     2. lines()   => This method split a string using line terminators and return a stream

                  => Return the stream of lines of multi-line string

     3. repeat()  => This method is used to duplicate or repeat a string

     4. stripLeading => It uses to remove the all leading white space from a string and it 
                        return a new string

     5. stripTrailing => This method is used to remove all trailing white spaces from a string
                         and returns new string

=========================
Java-11 => Var in Lambda 
=========================
     -> Java 11 allows to use var in a lambda expression and it can be used to apply modifies to 
        local variables

     -> Java compiler infers the type of variable at compile time

     -> It is introduced in java 10 and var is not a keyword

     -> var can be used in loops and you can't assign null to var 

     Note => There are some certain limitations on using var in lambda

          1. => var parameters can't be mixed with other parameters. It will throw compilation error

          2. => (var v1, v2) -> v1+v2 var parameter can't be mixed with other types parameters

          3. => (var v1, String v2 ) -> v1 + v2 var parameters can only by used with parenthecis

===============================
Java-11 => Collection To Array 
===============================
     -> Java 11 introduced a new method in the collection interface toArray(int function generator) method

     -> This method uses to convert a collection into an array

     -> The toArray() method is an overloaded method

          Syntax :: BArray = AList.toArray(String[]::new);

=========================
Java-11 => Not Predicate 
=========================
     -> Java 11 introduced new method to Predicate interface as not() to negate an existing predicate similar
        to negate method

==========================
Java-11 => Optional class 
==========================
	-> Optional class has isEmpty() to check if value is present

        -> isEmpty() returns false if value is present otherwise true

        -> It can be used as an alternative of isPresent() method which 
           often needs to negate to check if value is not present
