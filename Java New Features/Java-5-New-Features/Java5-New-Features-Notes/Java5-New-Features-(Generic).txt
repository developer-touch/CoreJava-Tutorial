>>>>>>Java5 New Features  Generics<<<<<<
---------------------------------------------------------------
	-> Generic is a java 5v new features
	-> This features is used for providing ' type safety '
	-> It is used for providing 'type information' to the compiler

	-> We want to provide the parameter type information during of instance creation but 
	    not during of method definition, in this case we must create class and methos with 
	    generic syntax

	-> With the generic syntax we can pass 'parameter type' as argument at runtime at the 
	     time of instance creation

	-> With generic syntax, we can specify the allowed values or objects as argument based 
	    on the instance

	-> Basically generics syntax is used for 
		1. Simplifying collection programming
		2. Avoiding class cast exception
		3. Avoiding the usage instanceof operator if condition
		4. Gives fast execution

	-> We can consider generic concept a label on a BOX on a BOOK
		
		1. BOX Collection
			box1	 -> pallis
			box2  -> kaju
			box3  -> almond
			box4  -> sugar
			box5  -> salt 

		2. BOOK Collection 
			book1  -> Maths 
			book2  -> Science
			book3  -> Social 
			book4  -> English
